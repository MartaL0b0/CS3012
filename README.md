## First Assignment: Lowest Common Ancestor
Due October 2nd, it consists of providing a program solution to the [Lowest Common Ancestor](https://www.hackerrank.com/topics/lowest-common-ancestor) problem. 

### Approach
The chosen programming language is [Python](https://www.python.org/) for its not-so-big learning curve and its increased popularity in multiple emerging technologies. 
```
For the purpose of this first assignment, the graph is assumed to be structured as a binary tree, in order to have a more standarised solution. 
```
For unit testing, after considering both [pytest](https://pytest.org/) and [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html), I decided to use the second one as more documentation to begin with was found. 

As a useful tool to improve testing, for this project the tool [Coverage.py](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/coverage-4.5.1x/index.html) is also included.
