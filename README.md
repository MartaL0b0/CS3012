# CS3012 Software Engineering 2018
Repository for all the projects related with [CS3012](https://scss.tcd.ie/Stephen.Barrett/teaching/CS3012/index.html), at Trinity College Dublin

## First Assignment: Lowest Common Ancestor
It consists of providing a program solution to the [Lowest Common Ancestor](https://www.hackerrank.com/topics/lowest-common-ancestor) problem. 

The chosen programming language is [Python](https://www.python.org/) for its not-so-big learning curve and its increased popularity in multiple emerging technologies. 
```
For the purpose of this first assignment, the graph is assumed to be structured as a binary tree, in order to have a more standarised solution. 
```
For unit testing, after considering both [pytest](https://pytest.org/) and [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html), I decided to use the second one as more documentation to begin with was found. 

As a useful tool to improve testing, for this project the tool [Coverage.py](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/coverage-4.5.1x/index.html) is also included. 


## Second Assignment: Lowest Common Ancestor in a Directed Acyclic Graph
More information can be found on the branch *new_requirements* 

## Third assignment: Engineer Biography
For this task, I chose to update my friend's [Luz Rello](http://www.luzrello.com/) Wikipedia page, which is currently only avaliable in [Spanish](https://es.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Luz_Rello_S%C3%A1nchez). It is meant to be uploaded in both languages by the end of 2018.

Luz is a Spanish researcher in HCI and Linguistics, and has developed a system to detect and treat dyslexia. Her social enterprise [Change Dyslexia](https://www.changedyslexia.org/) is helping more than 150 000 children worldwide to overcome this disorder.



## Forth assignment: Measuring Engineering
*To deliver a report that considers the ways in which the software engineering process can be measured and assesed in terms of measurable data, an overview of the computationial platforms available to perform this work, the algorithmic approachs available, and the ethics concerns surrounding this kind of analytics.*



## Fifth assignment: Github Access
This assignment will consist on a simple web client that, given a username and a password provided by the user, it will access the Github API using the Fetch JS API, and display some information about that user. It will be a first step towards the last assignment. 
The approach is inspired in [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJspH620ZsU&t=691s), which I used to set the starting point.

## How to run it
As it is just a Client Web File, there is no need for a server. The calls are done via browser, so an Internet conection is required.

## Sixth assignment: Social Graph
*Interrogate the GitHub API to build visualisation of data available tht elucidates some aspect of the softare engineering process, such as a social graph of developers and projects, or a visualisation of indiviudal of team performance. Provide a visualisation of this using the d3js library.*
