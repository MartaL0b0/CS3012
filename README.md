## First Assignment: Lowest Common Ancestor
Due October 2nd, consists of providing a program solution to the [Lowest Common Ancestor](https://www.hackerrank.com/topics/lowest-common-ancestor) problem. 

### Approach
The chosen programming language is [Python](https://www.python.org/) for its not-to-big learning curve and its increased popularity in multiple emerging technologies.

For the purpose of this first assignemnt, the graph is assumed to be structured as a binary tree, in order to have a more standarised solution. 
```
For unit testing, both [pytest](https://pytest.org/) and [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html) will be used, and then a decision will be made.
